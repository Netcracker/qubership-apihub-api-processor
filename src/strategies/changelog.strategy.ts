 * Recalculate the changelog of a version that is already published — `BUILD_TYPE.CHANGELOG`. A `build` that

 *
 * There is no release gate here, deliberately: `config.status` describes the published version rather than a
 * publication being attempted, so gating would leave a version with an unreliable changelog impossible to
 * recalculate. `test/release-gate.test.ts` pins that.
